Some verbs in the dictionary, although not approved, can be technical verbs in some
contexts.
Rule 1.12 gives all the necessary information and conditions to use
technical verbs correctly.
Verbs in the dictionary can be:
- Regular verbs
- Irregular verbs
- Irregular auxiliary verbs
- Defective modal verbs.
Usually, regular verbs add “-ed” to the base verb form to make the simple past tense and the past
participle form.
Do not use the past participle form if it is not in the dictionary.
Example:
that follow.

This column shows you:

You can frequently use different sentence constructions with other approved words and keep the
same meaning.
Many of the given examples come from the subject field of aircraft maintenance.
If you replace the
terms in the sentence with other applicable terms, you can use these examples for other subject
fields or domains.
If you work in a different subject field or domain, you can send a change form
with your examples for a possible inclusion in the dictionary.
Examples:
